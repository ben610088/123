# NDI TVC F-16 MATLAB Model

## Introduction

This is a MATLAB-based model of the F-16 aircraft thrust vector control (TVC). The goal of the project is to simulate and control the thrust vectoring of the F-16 aircraft to achieve more efficient maneuverability and more precise flight control. By implementing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) algorithm, this project can apply dynamic control of vertical and horizontal thrust vectors in the F-16 model to simulate its performance in various flight conditions.

## Version requirements
Sugesstion
Windows 10 (version 1909 or higher)
GPU:1080 or up  

## How to use

1. **Clome the Project：**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NDI-TVC-F16-MATLAB.git
2. **Open the src file**
   Cut all the file in the src file,then moving to external(123 file)  
3. **Open matlab**
   
4. **Open the NDI project:**
   NDI project is in the 123 file(that you cut in src) 
5. **Open the RunThis_LM.m, then run**

## Function Introduction

**Preload()**

All the parameter are in this fil.
I defines the parameter in different state with function

**Plot()**

Because this is the big project with many graphs, I use this file(function) to draw the plot that can express many states.

**NDI**


## Result

You will earn the Data from RunThis_LM.m with different state from F16 model.
Like row angle, pitch angle, velocity,etc.
The image will be presented as a line graph.
